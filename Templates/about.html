        <p class="h6 lead"> A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits and recurring accounts from the people and creates Demand Deposit.
            [1] Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial 
            stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional 
            reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations 
            intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.

            Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous 
            cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and l
            ending that had their roots in the ancient world. In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties – notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, 
            and the Rothschilds – have played a central role over many centuries. The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, 
            while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank.</p>
