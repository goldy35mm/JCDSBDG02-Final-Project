## Bank Loans

Objective:The primary objective of the bank is to provide their
  wealth in the safer hands. In recent times, banks approve
  loan after verifying and validating the documents provided
  by the customer. Yet there is no guarantee whether the
  applicant is deserving or not. This task classifies the
  customers based on certain criteria. The classification is
  done using Exploratory Data Analysis. Exploratory Data
  Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyse the datasets that
  summarizes the main characteristics with visual methods.
  The purpose of using EDA is to uncover the underlying
  structure of a relatively larger set of variables using
  visualizing techniques.I would need to predict using machine learning whether a Loan Application would be approved or rejected.

**Banks fundamental business model rely on financial intermediation by raising finance and lending (mortgage, real estate, consumer and companies loans). the latter is the major source of credit risk composed from 2 main points loan approval and rejected. In this task I will focus on loan approval by using machine learning models**

### CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

The main purpose of the task is to classify and analyse
the nature of the loan applicants. From a proper analysis of
data set and constraints of the banking sector, 
different graphs were generated and visualized. From the
graphs, many conclusions have been made and information
were inferred such as short-term loan was preferred by
majority of the loan applicants and the clients majorly apply
loan for debt consolidation.
This task work can be extended to higher level in future.
Predictive model for loans that uses machine learning
algorithms, where the results from each graph of the paper
can be taken as individual criteria for the machine learning
algorithm.Because the predictions are not 100%, there is an error of about 25% in predictions, resulting in predictions that are rejected will be accepted there are as many as 25%. Adding data parameters will help improve accuracy
